The file analyse.py is the one taking as an entry the dataset (csv file) and having as an output a file (txt for now, but can be a csv if more convenient) containing the average of returns of the K first assts for the N first days, and the covariance of returns.

the cpp code is only in its first version. Very messy, only one sheet instead of one per function, but works for the example (tested it versus Matlab).
To do: clean it, comment it, separate it on different sheets, make more protections (if file note of the good type, return error), use the returncodes to make it easy to read,...
